## üß≠ Overview

This hands-on workshop introduces engineering students to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** using **MATLAB** ‚Äî from working with real-world data to building and deploying intelligent models.  
It also integrates **prompt-to-programming** workflows, showing how natural language prompts can be transformed into executable MATLAB code for AI-driven problem-solving.

> ‚ÄúFrom data to decisions ‚Äî learn how to go from *prompt* to *program* using MATLAB and AI.‚Äù

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Load, preprocess, and visualize engineering datasets in MATLAB.  
- Train and test AI and machine learning models (classification, regression).  
- Apply deep learning using MATLAB‚Äôs **Deep Learning Toolbox** and **transfer learning**.  
- Generate and refine MATLAB code using AI prompt-based workflows.  
- Develop simple MATLAB Apps that integrate trained models for real-world use.
